Revision history for Template::Plugin::Dumpvalue

1.01 - 2004-09-07
     - Fixed dump_template_vars() so it actually dumps the template
     - stash rather than just return the object.
     - Made it so the dump output isn't saved in the object so
     - when dump_template_vars() is called you don't see the whole dump
     - twice.
